// WHAT IS THIS EVEN DOING?

// For questions 1-3, each code block is syntactically and logically correct. Your job is to describe what is happening. 
// They are in isolation -- variables in one question do not affect other questions.
// Describe the code as it would be run, and make sure you give us the console.log's value at the end.
// (Don't just say 'we console log the variable' -- instead say something like 'we console log 'yes'')


// 0. WRITE YOUR DESCRIPTION HERE
// //EXAMPLE. We make a variable called number and set it to 1 as a number.
// Then we increment the number variable. Number is now 2.
// We check if number is greater than or equal to 2. 2 is equal to 2, so
// we console.log 'yes'.

//CODE
/*
let number = 1;

number++;

if (number >= 2) {
  console.log('yes');
}

*/


// 1. WRITE YOUR DESCRIPTION HERE
// We make a variable called name and set it to Dane as a name.
// We make a condition that says if name is equal to Mary then the console.log should read 'Hi, Mary!'
// If the input is not Mary, then console.log should read, 'How do you do?'
//

//CODE
/*
let name = 'Dane';

if (name === 'Mary') {
  console.log('Hi, Mary!');
} else {
  console.log('How do you do?');
}


*/

// 2. WRITE YOUR DESCRIPTION HERE
// We create a variable called secret. 
// We make a variable called code and make it equal 123.
// We make a condition that says if code equals 123 is true, then secret will equal 'super' and code  will multiply by 2.
//
// We make another condition that says if code is greater than 250, then, secret is 'duper' 
// Console.log would be 246

//CODE
/*
let secret;

let code = 123;

if(code === 123) {
  secret = 'super';
  code = code * 2;
}

  secret = 'duper'

console.log(secret)

*/

// 3. WRITE YOUR DESCRIPTION HERE
// We make a variable called isStudent and make it equal true.
// We make a variable called age and make it equal 34.
// We make a variable called zip and make it equal 55407.
// We make a condition where if isStudent is true and zip is greater than 80000 then the console.log will read 'You're a student on the West Cost!'
// And if isStudent is false or the age input is less than 30, then console.log will read 'What are your hobbies?'
// And if isStudent is true then console.log will read 'Welcome to Prime!'
// If none of the above console.log are true, console.log will read 'How about the weather?'

//CODE
/*
let isStudent = true;
let age = 34;
let zip = 55407;

if (isStudent === true && zip > 80000 ) {
  console.log(`You're a student on the West Coast!`);

// REVERSE
// Now, for questions 4-6, we'll give you a description and some code. 
// Some of the code will NOT match the description.
// Comment above the problem code, and describe a potential solution.
// Look closely -- things are logically incorrect or missing and wrong in the code!

// EXAMPLE
// 0. (DESCRIPTION OF CORRECT BEHAVIOR)
// We make a variable called number and set it to 1 as a number.
// Then we increment the number variable. Number is now 2.
// We check if number is greater than or equal to 2. 
// -- it is, so we console.log 'yes'

//CODE
/*
let number = 1;

// FIX - number-- decrements number, but the instructions ask to increment. 
// Should be number++.
number--; 

if (number >= 2) {
  console.log('yes');
}

*/



//4. We start with three variables -- colorOne is set to 'blue' and 
// colorTwo is set to 'red', and mix is set to true. We check if mix is true 
// -- it is, so we set colorOne and colorTwo to 'purple'

/*
let colorOne = 'red';
let colorTwo = 'blue';
let mix = true;

// FIX - colorOne is set to blue and reads as read in the code. Change to 'blue'. colorTwo is set to 'red' but reads as 'blue'. Change to 'blue'.
// FIX - colorOne needs to change to a combo of colorOne and colorTwo in order to be true/purple 

if (mix === true) {
  colorOne = 'purple';
}
*/

//5. We start with two variables -- temp is set to 40 and time is set to 4.
// We check if temp is higher than 39 and if time is greater or equal to  4 
// -- they are so we console.log 'throw away the food!'

// The code reads if temp is greater than 39 or time is greater than 4 (not 'and')
// 

/*
let temp = 40;
const time = 4;

if (temp > 39 || time >= 4) {
  console.log('throw away the food!');

*/

//6. We start with two variables -- age is set to 21 and minAge is set to 21.
// We check if age is greater than or equal to minAge 
// -- it is, so we console.log 'enter'.

//minAge should read ">= age not <="
// If the purpose of the code is not to allow persons under 21 to enter site, the code should read
// if(minAge < age etc..)
